One day, a co-worker asked me about resources for learning Go. So, normally I would say “you can google it” but the truth is “really good” resource to help learner really understand behind the scene the core value of Go something like (Why are goroutines lightweight?). There are many random resources out there and they would take you a lot of time for choosing the wrong one to go with. That’s why I write this list to recommend some of the good resources to start learning Go.
