At **Dwarves Foundation,** we pursue a better engineering standard and evaluate **software engineers** who embody these seven character traits are valuable employees and productive contributors.

**Problem Solving**

All software is designed to solve user problem and within that general solution is a wide of range problems that make it up.

It doesn’t matter what programming language, framework, technology you use, if you can’t solve problem, you won’t be very good at developing software at all.

**Motivation**

Motivation is often not assessed in the interview process, which is unfortunate because it dictates so much of what we do and why. Further more, many companies focus so much on the day-to-day tasks and minutiae that they ultimately don’t offer their people any room for exploration and personal growth so that the reason why they losing motivate and jump in another company.

Selecting for motivation can be a challenge, and defies formula. Here, open source and open development can be a tremendous asset: it allows others to see what is being done, and, if they are excited by the work, to join the effort and to make their motivation clear.

**Values**

Values are often not evaluated formally at all in the software engineering process, but they can be critical to determine the “fit” of a candidate. To differentiate values from principles: values represent _relative importance_ versus the _absolute importance_ of principles. Values are important in a software engineering context because we so frequently make tradeoffs in which our values dictate our disposition. (For example, the relative importance of speed of development versus rigor; both are clearly important and positive attributes, but there is often a tradeoff to be had between them). Different engineering organizations may have different values over different times or for different projects, but it’s also true that individuals tend to develop their own values over their career — and it’s essential that the values of a candidate do not clash with the values of the team that they are to join.

**_Teamwork_**

The increasing growth of software world has brought up world-wide demand for high-skilled software engineers. To maintain software development and design, these workers must collaborate with each other. Poor communication and interaction among these people can reduce the quality of any product in this industry. If software teams work effectively with collaboration, they are not likely to fail projects.

These facts state that impact of skillful software teams must be considered vital. Over time, it can be seen that energy of teamwork enhances the success of projects periodically. However, several surveys, publications and interviews claim a redundance of team skills in the software industry, and a lack of resources for teaching them in undergraduate engineering programs. Project management, meeting, asynchronous communication, interaction, conflict management, group problem-solving, team-building, leadership. These skills are essential for a succesful teamwork in software development.

**Communication**

Great communication is the most important necessity for success as a software engineer. For most people this may sound unreasonable. Don’t developers spend all time coding? Actually, a big part of the day-to-day job of software engineering is not spent in code but rather working with a variety of folks across the company. It turns out software engineers, like other knowledge-workers, spend a ton of time collaborating across IM, email, reading designs, reviewing code and going to meetings. Our job often involves working across many parts of the company communicating with product management, account management, support, operations, sales, customers and of course with our peers and managers. As their career develops, software engineers end up spending most of their time communicating rather than actually coding. Ask any engineering manager, VP or CTO and most will tell you that their job is mostly about communication.

**Attitude**

In our tech and constantly changing reality, desire and willingness to learn is a crucial skill for surviving, improving and achieving any kind of success in the career and business.

**Integrity**

In an ideal world, integrity would not be something we would need to assess in a candidate: we could trust that everyone is honest and trustworthy. This view, unfortunately, is naïve with respect to how malicious bad actors can be; for any organization — but especially for one that is biased towards trust and transparency — it is essential that candidates be of high integrity: an employee who operates outside of the bounds of integrity can do nearly unbounded damage to an organization that assumes positive intent.
